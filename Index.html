            <h2>This feature was just released about 3-4 days ago as of my writing. If there are any issues, please let me know so I can fix them. Thank you.</h2>
            <h2>This feature is free to play for all players with only one requirement: you need to be on the Official Server to register each time you play.</h2>
            <h2>World boss has two ways to spawn:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>By vote in top.gg for Pokemeow: When it has enough votes (1000 votes), it will spawn if there's no boss spawn before it within 1 hour.</li>
                <li>By staff and admin spawn: Each staff in the Official Server has one spawn per day (reset at 11 AM (GMT+7) ). Admins can spawn multiple times (Their game,their rule xD) .</li>
                <li>After the boss spawns, you have 2 min to register . If you don't register in time, you can't fight the boss.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>SOME FUN FACTS ABOUT WORLD BOSS</h1>
        <h2>Bosses only have a small chance to attack your Pokémon (higher if you use GOLDEN MON).</h2>
        <h2>Bosses are immune to status effects and accuracy effects.</h2>
        <h2>It's quite easy to deal enough damage to get a reward. Remember, even if you're not in the Top 1 damage, you still have a chance to get exclusive rewards (Top 1 has a higher chance), so why not give it a try? xD</h2>
